            <h2>Psyvrse Devs — We Don’t Play, We Rewrite the Game</h2>
            <p>We don’t make bots. We dissect servers, rewrite reality, and sell nothing but annihilation. While other devs cry in subscription fees, we drop universes in your lap — free, flawless, and venomously polished. Ludus, Pax, Velicous… these aren’t bots. They’re ecosystems with teeth, minigames that bleed, economies that breathe, AI that actually thinks.</p>
            <p>250+ minigames? We don’t count. We curate chaos. Board games, card games, simulations, interconnected pets, fishing, farming, economies — we don’t innovate, we obliterate the concept. Other bots? They sell dust and call it gold. We hand you stars, galaxies, and black holes… for free.</p>
            <p>Genres? We don’t enter them. We rewrite them, crush them, and make your RPGs, music bots, and moderation tools look like infant toys in the corner crying for relevance. Their “premium features”? Our baseline ecosystem. Our AI doesn’t assist. It dominates.</p>
            <p>We are Psyvrse Devs. We smile while dismantling paywalls. We turn servers into living multiverses. We take what others charge for, and give it freely, violently, beautifully.</p>
            <p>Other bots exist to be compared. We exist to erase comparison entirely. Welcome to the era where Discord stops being a platform and becomes our playground. And yes… it’s free.</p>
            <p>We are Psyvrse Devs — a team unbound by convention, fueled by vision, and committed to shaping the future of Discord development. From Psyvrse Development Studios... It is a pleasure to meet you!</p>
